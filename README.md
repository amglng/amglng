## 🚀 About Me

I’m passionate about **anything that has to do with data** — from collecting and cleaning data, to analysing it and turning it into meaningful insights.

I’m currently in my **final year of Software Development at WeThinkCode_**, with a completed **Diploma in Administrative Information Management**. I enjoy building practical projects that sit at the intersection of **software engineering, data science, and data engineering**.

Alongside my studies, I actively work on **side projects on GitHub** that focus on:
- Data cleaning & analysis  
- Python-based data processing  
- SQL queries & relational databases  

I’m also pursuing the **IBM Applied Data Science with Python certification** to deepen my data science skills.
